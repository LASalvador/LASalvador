### Hi there 👋

My name is Lucas Salvador from Brazil (brazil). I've been working as Back-End Developer since 2018 and currently I'm Back-End at [Hotmart](https://hotmart.com/). 

In my free time I like to  watch F1 🚗 , to watch movies 🎞️ and series 📺 , to read books 📚, to listen to music 🎵 and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer 🍻.
